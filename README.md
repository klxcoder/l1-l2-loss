# L1 Loss (Mean Absolute Error)
  - Formula: $L1 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_i - \hat{y}_i|$
  - Less sensitive to outliners
  - More robust to noisy data

# L2 Loss (Mean Squared Error)
  - Formula: $L2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$
  - More sensitive to outliners
  - Can be significantly affected by noisy data
